This repository demonstrates an unexpected behavior of the `removeIf` function when used with the values of a `MutableMap` in Kotlin.  The `removeIf` function works as expected with `MutableList`, but behaves differently with the `values` collection of a `MutableMap`. The example code shows how `removeIf` on a `MutableList` correctly removes elements, while the same operation on a `MutableMap`'s `values` does not modify the original map.  The solution provides a workaround to achieve the desired behavior.
